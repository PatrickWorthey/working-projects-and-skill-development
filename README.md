# Working Projects and Skill Development

This repository is a space for applied learning and skill refinement. Projects here are built to support continued development.

Some projects are adapted from structured learning sources (e.g., classes, books, cert prep), while others are personal experiments and tool reconstructions. Each folder includes light documentation to explain the problem, approach, and lessons learned.


# Philosophy

The goal isn’t perfection, it’s progression.
